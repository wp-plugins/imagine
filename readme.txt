== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can i add a gallery in my page? =

Go to the page in wp-admin and select the gallery you want to use from the Imagine metabox. After selecting code will be generated which you can save into the page. All the rest happens automagically.

= Can i use multiple galleries on one page? =

Yes, you can. Even with different templates (and layover templates for image viewing).

= Can i create albums? =

Yes. With the same options as galleries.
